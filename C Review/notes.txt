The command gcc -g program.c -o program is a command-line instruction used to compile a C program using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), 
which is a standard compiler for C (and other languages like C++, Objective-C, Fortran, etc.) in Unix-like environments. 
Let's break down the command into its components:

gcc: This is the command to invoke the GCC compiler.

-g: This option tells GCC to include debugging information in the compiled program. 
The debugging information is used by debuggers like GDB or LLDB to provide information about 
variable names, line numbers, and other important data that helps in debugging the program. 
Without the -g option, the debugger may not be able to provide detailed information about the source code.

program.c: This is the source file you are compiling. 
It's a C language file, as denoted by the .c extension.

-o program: The -o option specifies the output file name. 
In this case, the compiled program will be outputted to a file named program. 
If you don't use the -o option, GCC by default creates an output file named a.out.

So, in summary, gcc -g program.c -o program compiles the program.c file with debugging information 
and outputs the compiled executable as program. This command is typically used during the development phase, 
where debugging might be necessary. For production builds, the -g option might be omitted to reduce the size of 
the executable and to potentially optimize performance.
